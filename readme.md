# Fractal.cs - the second dumbest way to render fractals

A couple months ago I attempted to generate fractal zooms using Typescript. While for the most part it worked, it had issues with floats and rounding errors. I've found these renders to be a great way to learn a language better, so I've been attempting to recreate it, and hopefully make it better in the process.

C# is faster than JS... Right?
